# React + TypeScript + Vite

This code snippet attempts to enable PrimeReact's Calendar component to receive and send in UTC+0 format. It currently converts from GMT+3, I did not test the rest of the timezones. I did not even properly test this either, but so far it seems to work. Will do further testing.
